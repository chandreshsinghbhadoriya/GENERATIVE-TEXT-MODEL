DESCRIPTION : A generative text model is a type of AI model that learns the patterns and structure of a text dataset and is capable of generating new, similar text. For example, after training on sentences about artificial intelligence, the model can create new sentences that look like they were written by a human.

enerative text models are primarily built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and more specifically, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units. These models are implemented using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.

he LSTM-based Generative Text Model is a powerful tool for AI-driven text generation. By learning from text corpora, it can produce coherent sentences, making it useful in applications like:

Chatbots,

Story writing,

Code completion,

Email suggestions, and more.
